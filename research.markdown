Current research
----------------
My academic research is strongly informed by my creative practice as a jazz composer and
pianist. In particular, I am interested in how the musical experiences of jazz composers and
performers (and to a lesser extent audience members) are mediated by their placements within
larger social groupings defined by 'race' and place. 

My
current research explores the biographies and music of two prolific and highly original South
African jazz composers, Lulama Gaulama and Paul Hanmer, each of whom were born
around 1960. Their music and personal stories offer fascinating perspectives on
apartheid and post-apartheid South African jazz culture and South African society more generally.

In my Masters/PhD research, I examined
how the music of three post-apartheid South African jazz groups, including my own,
sonically referenced its makers' and listeners' individual and wider social identities. [Please click here to view my PhD dissertation.](../pdf/ramanna_2005_dissertation.pdf)


Academic editing and peer review
---------------------------------
I enjoy editing and between 2009 and 2012 I edited or co-edited four
volumes of the journal [South African Music
Studies](https://www.sasrim.ac.za/samus/); in 2016 I guest-edited
a special issue of the journal _World of Music (new series)_ titled [South African
jazz culture: texts, contexts and
subtexts](http://www.journaltheworldofmusic.com/2016-2/). I am on the editorial
board of [Jazz Research
Journal](https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/journals/jazz-research-journal/) and
have peer reviewed for numerous journals
and academic
presses. 

Supervision
-----------
As a postgraduate supervisor, I have drawn on the full range of my research and
creative work. I have supervised jazz composition, performance, and research
topics from jazz drumset pedagogy to musical analysis of Sonny Rollins'
_Saxophone Colossus_ to jazz as a gendered discourse. I have also supervised
Honours long essays on the music of
Chopin and Madonna. One of my present PhD students considers the career
trajectories of six prominent South African jazz women and how their
experiences can be used to inform a more gender-inclusive and equitable jazz
pedagogical practice. A Masters student is analyzing the 'struggle songs' of
Miriam Makeba.
