I am a South African jazz pianist, composer and musicologist, now based in the UK.
Originally classically trained, I fell in love with jazz when I encountered the
music of Grover Washington and Oscar Peterson towards the end of high school.

In the early 1990s, while doing a BMus jazz degree at the University of Natal,
I co-founded the band Mosaic, which played a self-described
‘Indo-Afro-jazz’, combining North American jazz with aspects of African
jazz, Western art music and Indian classical music. I was the group's pianist
and its primary composer.
Based in Durban, we consciously sought to reflect in our music the cultural
dynamics at play in
that city. The band performed throughout South Africa, also giving concerts in
the USA and UK, disbanding in 1999.  

In 2004
I recorded the album 'A Thought', featuring Stan
Sulzmann, for New Canvas Records. Extracts from this recording were incorporated into the soundtrack of
Jyoti Mistry's film [We Remember
Differently](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388012/). I [continue to compose and
perform](../music/).

My [work as a musicologist](../research/) is strongly informed by my creative practice as a jazz composer and
pianist. In particular, I am interested in how the musical experiences of jazz composers and
performers (and, to a lesser extent, audience members) are mediated by their placements within
larger social groupings defined by 'race' and place. I have edited a number of
academic journals and supervised many postgraduate research projects.
